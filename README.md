# Flattest Route

Due to Google Map's new pricing, I have taken the site offline.

To run a local instance of the application:
1. Download the zip file from the green "Clone or Download" button near the top of this page.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Double-click the extracted `index.html`

Note: The may be a watermark added by Google saying "For development purposes only"
